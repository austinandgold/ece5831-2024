In this code we use the google teachable machine and create training data for the teachable machine to identify the hand shapes of "Rock, Paper, and Scissors". Once enough GOOD data was collected, the teachable machine was exported as an ".h5" file

Code was written line by line in the ipynb document going through function by fuctions, and testing different sample. Also, showing a picture of the sample. Once that was working, I created a .py file with the same fuctionality but a file path could be input by a user for the program to classify. There is also a live version where the integrate web cam is used and identifies the class in real time..
